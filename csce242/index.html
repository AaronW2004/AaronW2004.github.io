                    <p>For this assignment, I used Javascript For Loops in order to populate and keep count of a box with stars in it. I also added arrows so that the user can change the number of stars by clicking or entering a number. The feature will not allow you to enter a negative number of stars. </p>

                    <p>For this assignment, I used a Javascript Associative Array in order to allow the user to interact with images being stored in the array. When you hover over an image, it will expand, and if you click on it, the title and description of the image will appear.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p>For this assignment, I created a class used to include functionality on four separate images of birds. The purpose was to control the user experience so that upon clicking a picture of the bird a full description of the bird will appear. This can also be closed so that the user can click on a separate bird and see unique information.</p>
