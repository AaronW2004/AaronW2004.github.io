  <h2>Web Applications</h2>
  <h3>By: Aaron Williams</h3>
  <p>In this course we will be learning how to create web applications using HTML, CSS, and React. Overall, its fairly simple, but requires a lot of attention to detail and work. This class is a great example of the artistic and creative value in coding frontend web applications. Hopefully me and the rest of the class learn a great deal over the course of this summer!</p>
